## Solution
After taking a look at `data` i noticed the bottom sentence `I am just glad that you know how to use pickle`.
At this point i knew that pickle was required to decode the data, so i wrote this simple script:

```python3
#!/usr/bin/python3

import pickle

flag = ""

with open('data', 'rb') as f:
    unpack = pickle.load(f)

print(unpack)
```

Output:
```
{1: 'D', 2: 'UCTF', 3: '{', 4: 112, 5: 49, 6: 99, 7: 107, 8: 108, 9: 51, 10: 95, 11: 121, 12: 48, 13: 117, 14: 82, 15: 95, 16: 109, 17: 51, 18: 53, 19: 53, 20: 52, 21: 103, 22: 51, 23: '}', 24: "I know that the intelligence agency's are onto me so now i'm using ways to evade them: I am just glad that you know how to use pickle. Anyway the flag is "}
```
The unpacked data was a dictionary with some of its value being integers, so i tried converting those `int` to `char`.
To do that i modified the previous code:

```python3
#!/usr/bin/python3

import pickle

flag = ""

with open('data', 'rb') as f:
    unpack = pickle.load(f)

for i in range(1, len(unpack)):
    try:
        flag += chr(unpack[i])
    except:
        flag += unpack[i]

print(flag)
```
Output: `DUCTF{p1ckl3_y0uR_m3554g3}`
